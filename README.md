# Build and deploy a Stateful (Persistent) Nodejs *Microservice* on Azure Kubernetes Service
This project describes the steps for building and deploying a containerized *Node.js* microservice on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).  The microservice exposes a simple REST API for manipulating (CRUD) *Purchase Orders* and the purchase order documents (JSON messages) are persisted in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) No-SQL database.
